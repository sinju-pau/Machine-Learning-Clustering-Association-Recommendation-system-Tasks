# Machine Learning Clustering, Association, Anomaly Detection Systems, Recommendation Systems


This repository covers my analysis of Machine Learning projects in the areas such as: 
1. Clustering - eg. to identify customer groups based on purchase histories

      (i).  [k-Means and Hierarchial Clustering on Iris Species Data - using Python](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sinju-pau/Machine-Learning-Clustering-Association-Recommender-systems/blob/master/ClusteringIrisData.ipynb)



2. Association based on frequent itemset mining 
3. Anomaly Detection systems to identify the odd-one-out data
4. Recommender systems for giving recommendations to customers based on their ratings and likings of particular events

Some projects are also given on Cross-Validation and Dimensionality Reduction approaches:

1.  [Dimensionality Reduction (Principal Component Analysis and Linear Discriminant Analysis) - using Python](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sinju-pau/Machine-Learning-Clustering-Association-Recommender-systems/blob/master/DimensionalityReduction.ipynb)
