# Machine Learning Clustering, Association, Anomaly Detection Systems, Recommendation Systems


This repository covers my analysis of Machine Learning projects in the areas such as: 
1. Clustering - eg. to identify customer groups based on purchase histories or to classify plants according to their characteristic features

    [k-Means and Hierarchial Clustering on Iris Species Data - using Python](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sinju-pau/Machine-Learning-Clustering-Association-Recommender-systems/blob/master/ClusteringIrisData.ipynb)


2. Association based on frequent itemset mining 

    [Association Rule Learning : Apriori and Eclat on the Groceries Data - using R](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sinju-pau/Machine-Learning-Clustering-Association-Recommender-systems/blob/master/AssociationRulesGroceriesData.ipynb)

3. Anomaly Detection systems to identify the odd-one-out data

    [Anomalies/Outliers/Intrusion Detection on KDD Competition Data - using Python](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sinju-pau/Machine-Learning-Clustering-Association-Recommender-systems/blob/master/anomalyKDD.ipynb)


4. Recommender systems for giving recommendations to customers based on their ratings and likings of particular events

    [Recommender System on MovieLens Data - using Python]()


Some projects are also given on Cross-Validation and Dimensionality Reduction approaches:

  1.  [Dimensionality Reduction (Principal Component Analysis and Linear Discriminant Analysis) - using Python](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sinju-pau/Machine-Learning-Clustering-Association-Recommender-systems/blob/master/DimensionalityReduction.ipynb)
   
  2.  [Cross-Validation on Gesture Phase Segmentation Data - using Python](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sinju-pau/Machine-Learning-Clustering-Association-Recommender-systems/blob/master/GesturePhaseData-CV.ipynb)
