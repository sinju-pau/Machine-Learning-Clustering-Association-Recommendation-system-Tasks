# Machine Learning Clustering, Association, Anomaly Detection Systems, Recommendation Systems


This repository covers the analysis of datasets using various machine learning algorithms with varying complexities. Tha analysis is performed in R as well as in Python using Ipython Notebooks(.ipynb files). 

A working knowledge of R and Python is required to read through the scripts.

1. Clustering - eg. to identify customer groups based on purchase histories or to classify plants according to their characteristic features

    [k-Means and Hierarchial Clustering on Iris Species Data - using Python](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sinju-pau/Machine-Learning-Clustering-Association-Recommender-systems/blob/master/ClusteringIrisData.ipynb)


2. Association based on frequent itemset mining 

    [Association Rule Learning : Apriori and Eclat on the Groceries Data - using R](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sinju-pau/Machine-Learning-Clustering-Association-Recommender-systems/blob/master/AssociationRulesGroceriesData.ipynb)

3. Anomaly Detection systems to identify the odd-one-out data

    [Anomalies/Outliers/Intrusion Detection on KDD Competition Data - using Python](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sinju-pau/Machine-Learning-Clustering-Association-Recommender-systems/blob/master/anomalyKDD.ipynb)


4. Recommender systems for giving recommendations to customers based on their ratings and likings of particular events

    [Recommender System on MovieLens Data - using Python](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sinju-pau/Machine-Learning-Clustering-Association-Recommender-systems/blob/master/RecommenderSystemInPython.ipynb)


Here are some projects on Cross-Validation, Dimensionality Reduction, and Natural Language Processing approaches:

  1.  [Dimensionality Reduction (Principal Component Analysis and Linear Discriminant Analysis) - using Python](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sinju-pau/Machine-Learning-Clustering-Association-Recommender-systems/blob/master/DimensionalityReduction.ipynb)
   
  2.  [Cross-Validation on Gesture Phase Segmentation Data - using Python](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sinju-pau/Machine-Learning-Clustering-Association-Recommender-systems/blob/master/GesturePhaseData-CV.ipynb)
  
  3.  [Natural Language Processing : Analyzing text for Fake or Real News predictions - using Python](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sinju-pau/Machine-Learning-Clustering-Association-Recommender-systems/blob/master/NLPFakeNews.ipynb)
  
  
## Install

**For Python**

This repository requires **Python 3.6** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

**For R**

This repository requires **R** and the installation instructions and support can be obtained at :[R](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html)

To install the libraries in R, appropriate codes will be given at the beginning of the notebook

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

It is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution, which already has the above packages (including R) and more included. Make sure that Python 3.6 installer is selected. 

## Code

Template code is provided in the `.ipynb` notebook files. Note that separate files such as .py or .R are not included in the repository. You can jump to the notebooks clicking on the links in appropriate sections.

## Run

Download the required notebooks. In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory(that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook notebookname.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook notebookname.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook in your browser.

## Data

The data files may required to be downloaded through the source links provided in the notebook and saved in the same Directory as the notebook file
