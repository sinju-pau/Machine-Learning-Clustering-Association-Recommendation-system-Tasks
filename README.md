# Machine Learning Clustering, Association, Anomaly Detection Systems, Recommendation Systems


This repository covers my analysis of Machine Learning projects in the areas such as Clustering to identify customer groups based on purchase histories, Association based on frequent itemset mining, Anomaly Detection systems to identify the odd-one-out data and Recommender systems for giving recommendations to customers based on their ratings and likings of particular events.
